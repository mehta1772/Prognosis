## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on input parameters such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Uses logistic regression to predict the presence of heart disease using various health metrics.
- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction**: Utilizes XGBoost to assess the likelihood of Parkinson's disease based on voice and speech characteristics.

## Models Used

- **Diabetes Model**: SVM model trained on diabetes-related health data.
- **Heart Disease Model**: Logistic Regression model trained on heart disease datasets.
- **Parkinson's Model**: XGBoost model trained on voice and speech features related to Parkinson's disease.
